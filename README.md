# op-npm-install-all-from-import

A Node.js package for automatically installing npm packages based on import statements in your project files.

## Introduction

When you copy a project that doesn't have a `package.json` file, it can be challenging to identify and install all the required npm packages manually. `op-npm-install-all-from-import` simplifies this process by automatically scanning your project's source files, detecting import statements, and installing missing npm packages for you.

## Features

- Scans your project's source files for import statements.
- Installs missing npm packages based on the detected imports.
- Automatically skips local imports (those starting with `"."`).
- Easy to use and integrate into your workflow.

## Installation

You can install `op-npm-install-all-from-import` globally to use it as a command-line tool.

```bash
npm install -g op-npm-install-all-from-import
```

## Usage

To use `op-npm-install-all-from-import`, simply run it in your project directory. It will scan your project files, identify import statements, and install missing npm packages.

```bash
op-npm-install-all-from-import
```

You can also specify a directory path to scan if your project structure is different from the default.

```bash
op-npm-install-all-from-import /path/to/your/project
```

## Programmatically

You can use `op-npm-install-all-from-import` programmatically in your Node.js scripts:

```javascript
import load from "op-npm-install-all-from-import";

// To scan the current project directory
load();
```

To specify a custom directory, you can pass it as an argument to the load function:

```javascript
import load from "op-npm-install-all-from-import";

// To specify a custom directory
load("path/to/your/project");
```
